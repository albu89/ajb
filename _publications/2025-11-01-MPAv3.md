This study presents a retrospective analysis comparing the memetic pattern–based algorithm (MPA v3), a novel scientific diagnostic model, with the ESC 2024 RF-CL algorithm for identifying coronary artery disease. The evaluation examines diagnostic performance, clinical discrimination, and applicability in real-world patient cohorts.
