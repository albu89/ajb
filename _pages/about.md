I am an engineer and product leader defining how foundation models and clinical AI are built for real-world medicine.
My work focuses on creating safe, physiologically grounded AI systems that improve diagnosis, guide treatment decisions, and advance our understanding of human disease.

## Short Bio  

I am the founding Product and Engineering leader at Exploris Health, where I design and build next-generation clinical foundation models and AI diagnostics for cardiovascular disease. My work spans product positioning & placement,  model architecture, data strategy, clinical workflow design, and regulatory deployment.

Previously, I served as a Director at Idorsia, where I led Real-World Evidence, HTA Statistics, and a Computational Science group supporting both development and commercialization. Before that, I was the Global Product and Machine Learning Leader at IBM, responsible for the Life Sciences portfolio within IBM’s Global AI Team. I began my career as an Equity Structurer at Deutsche Bank, developing quantitative models in high-pressure, decision-critical environments.


## Research & Innovation 

My research centers on representation learning for clinical and physiological data, with an emphasis on safety, grounding, and translational utility. I develop methods that:

• model noisy, biased, and incomplete real-world data,  
• guide transformers toward physiologically meaningful behavior,  
• improve biomarker discovery and multimodal disease modeling,  
• enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment-effect estimation, and  
• build ontology-driven and foundation-model architectures for medicine.

My work spans diagnostics and therapeutics, supporting multiple launched products and demonstrating strong translational and regulatory impact. I focus on bridging foundational research with deployable, clinically trustworthy AI systems.
