I am an engineer, product and real-world evidence leader focused on developing physiologically grounded AI systems with translational impact in diagnostics, disease phenotyping, and therapeutic evidence generation.

## Short Bio  

I am the founding Product and Engineering leader at Exploris Health, where I design and build  clinical foundation models and AI diagnostics for cardiovascular disease. My work spans product positioning & placement, clinical development (evidence generation) and R&D of foundational models. 

Previously, I served as a Director at [Idorsia](https://www.idorsia.com), where I led Real-World Evidence, HTA Statistics, and a Computational Science group supporting both development and commercialization. Before that, I was the Global Product and Machine Learning Leader at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), responsible for the Life Sciences portfolio within IBM’s Global AI Team. I began my career as an Equity Structurer at Deutsche Bank, developing quantitative models in high-pressure, decision-critical environments.


## Research & Innovation 

My research centers on representation learning for clinical and physiological data, with an emphasis on safety, grounding, and translational utility. I develop methods that:

• model noisy, biased, and incomplete real-world data,  
• guide transformers toward physiologically meaningful behavior,  
• improve biomarker discovery and multimodal disease modeling,  
• enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment-effect estimation, and  
• build ontology-driven and foundation-model architectures for medicine.

My work spans diagnostics and therapeutics, supporting multiple launched products and demonstrating strong translational and regulatory impact. I focus on bridging foundational research with deployable, clinically trustworthy AI systems.
