I led the development of a next-generation continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) solution designed to be simple, predictive, and patient-centric. The system continuously sends glucose readings to a smartphone, features a fast and easy sensor application process, and offers up to 14 days of wear with a 1-hour warm-up period.

The product provides forward-looking insights by showing current glucose levels and projected trends, including intelligent predictions up to seven hours ahead. Users can personalize alerts for high or low glucose levels and benefit from an intuitive interface that clearly visualizes all relevant data to support effective diabetes management.
